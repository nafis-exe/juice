**HELLEVATOR**

**Team Members:** [Your names here]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
ultrakill but its just a middle aged man swept into hell from an elevator from his office apartment

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
the movement and weapons should make it pretty clear to the player that this is meant to be a speedrunning game. meaning theres no limit to how fast you can go. any strategy you find. use it.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
*elevator dings* you are now in hell. then the elevator opens and you're forced to punch off a few enemies chasing you

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
make them fall into the trap of improvement. that feeling that "i could do a LITTLE bit better" and have them entrapped into the game for eternity.. or as long as you like :)
